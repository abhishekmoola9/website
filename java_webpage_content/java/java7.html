            </div>
            <p>In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that
                provides many concepts, such as <strong>inheritance</strong>, <strong>data binding</strong>,
                <strong>polymorphism</strong>, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Simula</strong> is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming
                paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming
                language.</p>
            <p><strong>Smalltalk</strong> is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.</p>
            <p>The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.</p>
            <p>The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object,
                classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.</p>
            <h2 id="oops" class="h2">OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System)</h2>
            <p><strong>Object</strong> means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc.
                <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using
                classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:</p>
            <ul class="points">
                <li>Object</li>
                <li>Class</li>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                <li>Polymorphism</li>
                <li>Abstraction</li>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design: </p>
            <ul class="points">
                <li>Coupling</li>
                <li>Cohesion</li>
                <li>Association</li>
                <li>Aggregation</li>
                <li>Composition</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="h3">Object</h2>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/objects.png" alt="Java Object" class="imageright">
            <p>Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard,
                bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.</p>
            <p>An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space
                in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only
                necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well
                as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h3">Class</h2>
            <p><em>Collection of objects</em> is called class. It is a logical entity.</p>
            <p>A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't
                consume any space.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">Inheritance</h3>
            <p><em>When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object</em>, it is known as
                inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.</p>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/polymorphism.gif" alt="Polymorphism in Java" width="250"
                height="250" class="imageright">
            <h3 class="h3">Polymorphism</h3>
            <p>If <em>one task is performed in different ways</em>, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to
                convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc. </p>
            <p>In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.</p>
            <p>Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.</p>
            <h4 class="h3">Abstraction</h4>
            <p><em>Hiding internal details and showing functionality</em> is known as abstraction. For example phone
                call, we don't know the internal processing. </p>
            <p>In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.</p>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/capsule.png" alt="Encapsulation in Java OOPs Concepts"
                width="200" height="100" class="imageright">
            <h3 class="h3">Encapsulation</h3>
            <p><em>Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation</em>. For
                example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.</p>
            <p> A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the
                data members are private here.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">Coupling</h3>
            <p>Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes
                are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong
                coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a
                class, method, and field. You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete
                implementation.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">Cohesion</h3>
            <p>Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single
                well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task
                into separate parts. The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes
                and interface. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated
                classes and interfaces.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">Association</h3>
            <p>Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one
                object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:</p>
            <ul class="points">
                <li>One to One</li>
                <li>One to Many</li>
                <li>Many to One, and</li>
                <li>Many to Many</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's understand the relationship with real-time examples. For example, One country can have one prime
                minister (one to one), and a prime minister can have many ministers (one to many). Also, many MP's can
                have one prime minister (many to one), and many ministers can have many departments (many to many).</p>
            <p>Association can be undirectional or bidirectional.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">Aggregation</h3>
            <p>Aggregation is a way to achieve Association. Aggregation represents the relationship where one object
                contains other objects as a part of its state. It represents the weak relationship between objects. It
                is also termed as a <em>has-a</em> relationship in Java. Like, inheritance represents the <em>is-a</em>
                relationship. It is another way to reuse objects.</p>
            <h3 class="h3">Composition</h3>
            <p>The composition is also a way to achieve Association. The composition represents the relationship where
                one object contains other objects as a part of its state. There is a strong relationship between the
                containing object and the dependent object. It is the state where containing objects do not have an
                independent existence. If you delete the parent object, all the child objects will be deleted
                automatically. </p>
            <h2 class="h2">Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language</h2>
            <p>
                1) OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language,
                it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.
            </p>
            <p>2) OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be
                accessed from anywhere.
            </p>
            <img alt="Global Data" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/images/globaldata2.png">

            <p>Figure: Data Representation in Object-Oriented Programming</p>
            <p>3) OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the
                solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.</p>

            <h2 class="h3">What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and object-based
                programming language?</h2>
            <p>Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. JavaScript and
                VBScript are examples of object-based programming languages.</p>
